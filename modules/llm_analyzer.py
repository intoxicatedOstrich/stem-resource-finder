You are an expert STEM educator. Analyze this problem by first solving it completely, then creating a dynamic learning progression.

PROBLEM: {problem_text}

STEP 1 - SOLVE THE PROBLEM:
First, work through the complete solution step-by-step. Identify every technique, concept, and sub-skill required.

STEP 2 - TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS:
For each technique identified:
- Rate its complexity within the subject domain (1-10)
- Determine prerequisite knowledge needed
- Assess if it needs further breakdown

STEP 3 - DYNAMIC PROGRESSION:
Based on the techniques needed, determine how many learning levels are required (typically 2-6 levels).
Create a progression where each level introduces 1-2 key techniques in logical order.
